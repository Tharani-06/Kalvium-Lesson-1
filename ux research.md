Imagine you're a detective gathering evidence. UX research is similar, providing the evidence we need to design effectively.

## Planning Your UX Research

Planning UX research is like creating a roadmap to understand your users. Know your destination before you start your journey.

1.  **Define Research Objectives:** What do you want to learn?
2.  **Identify Target Users:** Who are you learning from? Create **user personas** (a representation of your target audience).
3.  **Choose Research Methods:** Select methods for your goals.
4.  **Create a Research Plan:** Outline steps, timeline, and resources.
5.  **Recruit Participants:** Find people matching your user profiles.

## UX Research Methods

There are two main types of UX research methods: **qualitative** and **quantitative**.

## Analyzing User Feedback

After gathering data, analyze it to find insights. Like finding gold nuggets in sand.

### Steps for Analyzing User Feedback:

1.  **Organize Your Data:** Compile data in one place.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for recurring themes.
3.  **Prioritize Issues:** Focus on critical issues.

## Translating Insights into Design Improvements

Turn insights into design changes to enhance user experience.

### Techniques for Translating Insights:

1.  **Iterate on Designs:** Refine designs based on feedback.
